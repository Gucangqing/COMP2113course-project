2. Description and game rules.

A knight saving a princess from the dragon. There are three traps/barriers for the knight to pass and a final battle between the knight and the dragon. 
The knight has Hit point (HP), Mana point (MP), and golden coins. He can get to a higher level of HP, MP, and earn more coins by the previous battles. Higher MP leads to a higher damage to his enemies. The coins can be used to buy medicines and weapons in the store. 

The knight will start from the noice village to learn some basic skills. On his road to the black castle, he will first meet some little monsters in the forest, some traps left by the hunter, and some guards from the castle. The difficulty of passing the barriers will increase, and the last one with the dragon is the hardest. Finally, if he has cleared all the stages, he can meet the princess, but he still has to answer some questions to take her away. 

Rules:
If the knight loses all his HP on his way, the player loses the game.
If the knight is still alive after beating the dragon and answer the princess's question correctly, the player wins the game.
